## About The Notes

```java
class Notes {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the memo space :)");
  }
}
```

Hello everyone!! welcome to the 04's memo and notes. The purpose of this repo is to record the common questions and provide a space for people who want to get back to these **Easy-to-Forget** or **Hard-to-Understand** questions in a later time. The repo will be updated in a regular manner.

- This is not a repo that cover all the course material or Java Basics;
- It may covers some concepts that are out-of-scope but good-to-know.

Please refer to course material and lab notes to get a full view of this course!

## Save it to your own space

For people who wish to see the notes in your own Github repositary, here I provide instructions on how to `fork` it; One of the benefit is that you see when I update the file and then you can `sync` by clicking one botton;

- You should have your own Github account;
- Click the `Fork` botton on the right cornor near `Code`
