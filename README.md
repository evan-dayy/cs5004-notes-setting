# About The Notes

```java
class Notes {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the memo space :)");
  }
}
```

Hello everyone!! welcome to the 04's memo and notes. The purpose of this repo is to record the common questions and provide a space for people who want to get back to these **Easy-to-Forget** or **Hard-to-Understand** questions in a later time. The repo will be updated in a regular manner. 

* This is not a repo that cover all the course material or Java Basics;
* It may covers some concepts that are out-of-scope but good-to-know.

Please refer to course material and lab notes to get a full view of this course!

- You should have your own Github account;
- Click the `Fork` botton on the right cornor near `Code`
