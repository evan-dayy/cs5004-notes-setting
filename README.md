#### Hello everyone, welcome to the 04's memo and notes. The purpose of this repo is to record the common questions and provide a space for people who want to get back to these questions in a later time. The repo will be updated in a regular manner.

# Save it to your own space

#### For people who wish to see the notes in your own Github repositary, here I provide instructions on how to `fork` it; One of the benefit is that you see when I update the file and then you can `sync` by clicking one botton;

- You should have your own Github account;
- Click the `Fork` botton on the right cornor near `Code`
