<!-- ## GradeScope Autograder Not Working Issue

People may encounter issues such as cannot see auto-grader output and get a 0 points. The issue is related to **Java Compile Time Error**, which is hidden from students' side. Typically, the error related to Java compile-time checking. Here I list a few of examples:

- Type Checking. Autograder may have a test case `mutiply(double val)`, however the submitted state it as `mutiply(int val)`;
- Wrong name of method. Autograder will directly call the function, so mis-typing function name may cause `symbols cannot found`;
- Forgot the `package` keyword when you declare a class inside a package;
- Wrong output type. Return a `double` but expected a `int` type, it will cause `Lossy conversion problem`;
- ...

Please double check your function signature, return type, output type, and also edge cases before submitting to GradeScope. Since it will not display the compile-time errors. If you cannot debug the issue, feel free to reach out to TAs to help you go through the code; -->
